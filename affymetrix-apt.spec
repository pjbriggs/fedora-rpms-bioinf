%description
Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) are a set of cross-platform command line programs
that implement algorithms for analyzing and working with Affymetrix GeneChip
arrays. APT is an open-source project licensed under the GNU General Public
License (GPL). (Developers who need a non-GPL license may purchase a commercial
license from Affymetrix.) APT programs are intended for "power users" who
prefer programs that can be utilized in scripting environments and are
sophisticated enough to handle the complexity of extra features and
functionality. The vision is that APT provides a platform for developing and
deploying new algorithms without waiting for the GUI implementations.
